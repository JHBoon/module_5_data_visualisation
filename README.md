This projects visualizes data on a dataset about mice that have been treated with a variety of cancer treatments. It analyses the performance of the drugs.

This project includes the following topics:
        mean
        median
        variance
        standard deviation
        Bar plot
        Pie Chart
        Linegraphs
        Box plot
        Scatterplots
        Linear regression
        Correlation coefficient

I've used the activity files, my own notes, The Xpert AI and ChatGTP to come to these solutions.
